# find_by_sql_paginately

This gem is to add extra parameters to Rails original method ``find_by_sql`` so that developers like us can do pagination without so much hassle of manipulating the SQL.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'find_by_sql_paginately', '~> 0.1.0'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install find_by_sql_paginately

## Usage

With this gem install you can run the normal ``find_by_sql`` but with extra parameters per_page and page like below. Note that, there would be 3 extra methods ``total_pages``, ``total_count``, ``page`` that you can used to faciliate the pagination rendering.

```ruby
users = User.find_by_sql('SELECT * FROM users', per_page: 10, page: 1)
# => First page of 10 users will be returned

users.total_pages
# => Total Pages
users.total_count
# => Total Records
users.page
# => Current Page
```

You also can run the SQL with variable replacement like followings:

```ruby
users =
  User
  .find_by_sql(
    ['SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > ?', 1],
    per_page: 10,
    page: 1
  )

# OR

users =
  User
  .find_by_sql(
    ['SELECT * FROM users WHERE id > :id', { id: 1 }],
    per_page: 10,
    page: 1
  )
```

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake test` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
